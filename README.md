# My own sudoku game
I love sudoku but I'm not completely happy with sudoku.com

## Project goals
1. Don't overdo it. Finish in a weekend
2. One click new game
3. Dark mode
4. In sudoku.com, clicking a cell higlights its row and column. I'd like the row and column of every other cell with the same number to be highlighted as well but in a lighter colour
5. Vanilla JS so this can easily be hosted with GitHub Pages' free plan
