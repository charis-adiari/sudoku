# My own sudoku game
I love sudoku but I'm not completely happy with sudoku.com

## Project goals
1. Don't overdo it. Finish in a weekend
2. One click new game
3. Dark mode
4. ~~In sudoku.com, clicking a cell higlights its row and column. I'd like the row and column of every other cell with the same number to be highlighted as well but in a lighter colour~~
5. When entering notes in a cell, highlight if a note conflicts with existing cells in row, column and block
6. Vanilla JS so this can easily be hosted with GitHub Pages' free plan
7. Immediately highlighting mistakes (and maybe also the tool in number 5) are "training wheels", which shouldn't be enabled by default
